## Coins Program

**This is a simple program made for AP Comp Sci assignment**

## Purpose

- Take **input** of the amount of coins user has
- **Output** relevant information like $ amount and coin rolls needed to store them

> I tried to add spice to the assignment by challenging myself to do almost everything in **_for_** loops (I struggle with grasping them and how iteration works)
